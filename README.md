# Toxic-Comment-Classification
This project is the sub-project of my other project, where I need to eliminate the toxic comments by users. 

## Background

ReviewMyProfessors.com, is the website where students can review the professors. But, always such websites are haunted by toxic comments
and causes problem for website owners to eleminates such comments. Instead of manually, identifying and eliminating toxic comments, I decided
to put Machine Learning at work.

## Implementation

### Pre-Processing
1) Filtering comments according to average length
2) Removing punctuations
3) Removing stop words (ex: a, about, because etc)
4) Stemming and Lemmatising
5) Applying Count Vectoriser
